# Filter Range Exercise

## Description

Return a new array with numbers from `arr` between `a` and `b` (inclusive) **without changing the original array**.

## Keypoints

- Use `filter()` to select numbers that satisfy `a <= item && item <= b`.
- Do **not** modify the original array.
- Focus on **returning a new array**, leaving the original array intact.
