# Shuffle Array Exercise

## Description

Make a function that mixes (shuffles) an array.

The original array changes.  
Each shuffle can give a different order.

## Key Points

- The array changes in place.
- `sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` is simple but not perfect.
- Test many times to see different orders.
