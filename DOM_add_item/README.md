## What I Learned

- How JavaScript manipulates the DOM instead of directly editing HTML
- How events connect user actions (click) to logic
- How to create and append elements dynamically
- How to validate input using a guard clause
- How to think in logic flow rather than just syntax
- How small, meaningful commits help track learning
- How discussing code and asking “why” leads to deeper understanding

## Goal

The goal of this project was to practice real-world DOM manipulation basics, not visual design.
