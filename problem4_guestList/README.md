# Admit or Refuse Exercise

## Description

Loop through a list of people and separate them into admitted and refused groups based on their names.

## Instructions

1. Loop through the `people` array using a `for...of` loop.
2. For each person:
   - If the name is `"Phil"` or `"Lola"`, add it to `refused.textContent` (separated by `, `).
   - Otherwise, add it to `admitted.textContent` (separated by `, `).

## Key Points

- Use a conditional (`if...else`) to distinguish between refused and admitted.
- Use `for...of` to iterate through the array.
