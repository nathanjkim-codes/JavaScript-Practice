# Copy and Sort Array Exercise

## Description

Create a function that **returns a sorted copy of an array** without modifying the original array.

- The original array remains unchanged.
- The new array is sorted in **alphabetical order** (A â†’ Z for strings).

## Key Points

- Use `slice()` to create a **shallow copy** of the array.
- Use `sort()` to sort the copied array.
- Understand that `sort()` **modifies the array it is called on**, so copying is necessary to preserve the original array.
