# Sort in Decreasing Order Exercise

## Description

Sort the elements of an array in **decreasing order** (from largest to smallest).  
The **original array will be modified** to reflect the sorted order.

## Keypoints

- Use `sort()` with a **comparison function** to sort numbers in decreasing order.
- The comparison function should return `b - a` to order from largest to smallest.
- Understand that `sort()` **modifies the original array**.
