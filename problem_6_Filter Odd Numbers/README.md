# isOdd & filter Example

## Description

This example demonstrates how to use the `filter()` method in JavaScript to extract odd numbers from an array.

- We define a helper function `isOdd()` that checks whether a number is odd.
- Then we use `filter()` to create a new array containing only odd numbers.
- The original array remains unchanged.
